## Prince / Slurm

You can run an interactive session with following command:

```bash
srun -t3:30:00 --mem=3000 --gres=gpu:1 --pty /bin/bash
```

This requests a machine with 3GB RAM and a GPU. If you're lucky, you should instantly access a machine--occasionally, the GPUs are oversubscribed and it takes a long time to get a machine.

After you get a machine, you still need set up your environment, this often includes:

* Loading 'modules' that set up the CUDA libraries (I think?)
* Activate a conda environment
* Add additional environment variable configurations

## Training a CoLA model

I trained a CoLA model using a .conf file in this repository:

```bash
python main.py \
    --config_file ../seminar_experiments/configs/cola.conf \
    --overrides "exp_name = my_exp, run_name = my_cola"
```

This configuration gets about a 0.36 MCC.

## Running a REPL for CoLA

To run a REPL based on a trained model:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH python \
    src/interface/repl.py \
    --config_file ../seminar_experiments/configs/cola_repl.conf \
    --overrides "exp_name = my_exp, run_name = my_cola"
```

Note that the arguments are identical to the above training command.

The REPL script is currently in a separate fork of jiant, found here: https://github.com/zphang/jiant/blob/seminar/src/interface/repl.py

The REPL code is still subject to change over time, and may be merged into the core jiant code base in the future.

(The PYTHONPATH modification is necessary because `repl.py` is not in the root directory of jiant.)
